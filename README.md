# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Support-Vector-Machine

In this project, I predicted whether an individual is diabetic or not using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC). The model achieved an accuracy of 76%. During model development, I detected and removed outliers and duplicates. Additionally, I fine-tuned model parameters using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize performance. The trained model was saved using pickle and deployed via Flask.

### Summary of the steps:

- Import necessary libraries 
- Loading the dataset
- Inspecting the dataset 
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Prepare data for model building
- Build the classification model
- Hyperparameter tuning 
- Save the model 
- Build a Flask web app
